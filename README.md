Bring life back to sams, and upgrading  to NWN Enhanced Edition to run multiplayer online (Nwnx)

## $ the goal here is to bring a beloved (DnD 5e rules rpg) multiplayer online mod that started 20 years ago up to date and compatible with NWN:EE NWNX, CEP2.7, CEP 3.1 amd go from 3 edition rules to 5e rules
### to ensure code stability and project workflow, we will be using github to check in/out files, assign issues to certain teams, have a bonafide issue/support system and allow for collabs with other skilled people
### this setup is designed to quickly keep track of all changes and help us mash it all backtogether proper like.

### Got a new concept? go ahead and do a pull request, all the way thru review and by the time we SEE it happen, it will be easier to just commit it to the mod
