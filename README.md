# 08/01/2023 update
-- a *builder's* mod will be available soon for those interested in learning or assisting on developing with us. 
-- testing begins this month - we will need players to test race/subrace builds, (because we have new system) leveling, area trams, saves, spawns, and make sure the NPC's dont go postal on you.... etc.  *these tests are NOT part of the Campaign prep testing*

### anyone a writer/hobby writer? 
-- I need someone to who likes to write/type help DM Fubar compile/write lore books for the mod. Check Discord for more info

### to ensure code stability and project workflow, we will be using github to check in/out files, assign issues to certain teams, have a bonafide issue/support system and allow for collabs with other skilled people
### this setup is designed to quickly keep track of all changes and help us mash it all backtogether proper like.

### Got a new concept? go ahead and do a pull request, all the way thru review and by the time we SEE it happen, it will be easier to just commit it to the mod
